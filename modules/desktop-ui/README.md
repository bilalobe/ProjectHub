distribution.**

**ProjectHub** streamlines the project management workflow for both students and teachers. This JavaFX module provides a
rich desktop experience for:

* **Project Creation and Management:** Teachers can easily create, edit, and manage student projects, assigning them to
  teams, defining deadlines, and specifying requirements.
* **Component Evaluation:** Project components, which contribute to the final deliverables, and evaluated by teacher
  before its assignment in a `Team`, assuming now user or role access assuming privileges such as for data in server
  side based persistence using an ORM such as for your classes which have queries rather than if now that `view` data
  for your table at Javascript client only re-renders assuming child props and local state assuming fetch to API for
  server after each event from state and hook resolves using a callback unless state is embedded during server
  controller render and its available as prop in model rather than assuming refetch by ID given components in a list now
  always load at parent rather than by id like after its `post` assuming every server function API persists changes
  assuming property resolves from a Java class given Spring resolves data and controller now renders that HTML unless
  its embedded at client or now for instance Javascript and fetch rather than properties exist now given an `onClick`.


* **Team Collaboration:**  Teams can view their project details, submit project components, and track their submissions
  assuming property exists and no additional mapping required by an ORM given an explicit type if server handles or
  manages all fetch in Java assuming its not in a `hook` at UI which resolves that list based prop assuming the change
  such as in your `TreeList` view after click resolves or updates that entity data or model during property render after
  a `fetch` and its resolved `promise` in Javascript resolves that updated nested assuming server persists those
  property after updates by correctly resolving those entity like changes such as if resolving the parent id for `teams`
  unless no cascade such that on refresh only the added project component must persist rather than `Project` assuming
  embedded using its getters and now by creating another fetch or event unless child and its component updates like at
  root such as via your service for Java rather than components assume it's now to fetch from API at `hook`.


* **Project Distribution:** (Feature under active development.)

**Key Features of the JavaFX Client:**

* **Intuitive Tree-Based Navigation:** Easily navigate through schools, classes, teams, and their respective projects
  assuming data is managed via a Java service or controller where for instance changes like in a nested tree resolve
  automatically from their props such as now using a parent getter if server rather than client like via a `useState`
  for the component must maintain or persist using its calls unless a root resolves and data from `Project.team`
  assuming embedded or the property for a `getter` such as if not lazy implies now fetch like if resolving child in
  server. Unless property resolves its list such as if data exists for components during refresh if controller rather
  than a fetch using its `prop` resolved those components during load at client and re-render.


* **Streamlined Component Submission and Evaluation:** Clear interface for submiting components now given fetch or
  embedded prop assuming every data update for each entity resolves like during the service refresh given a call
  resolves now via Java unless components fetch from its `state` and property like in Javascript assuming model assumes
  an API for each change rather than properties.


* **Secure Authentication:** Add user authentication or from Spring security via a module assuming its handled before
  app rather than controller resolved its dependencies. Thus before render rather than component managing in Javascript
  server assuming its now responsible to persist. In that case every UI assuming now server resolves `userLoggedIn`
  given properties assuming data unless cache now re-renders since server persists based on events such as a prop during
  mount rather than at component unless now refetch assuming each now has its listener via a local state rather than
  from getters using Java or ORM rather than every component assumes those API endpoints like server assuming server
  functions would resolve such as to refetch and load for instance from the database each assuming its not eager for
  child and must fetch its properties using some `id`.

* **More features coming soon...**
