# ProjectHub Architectural Migration Report

## Executive Summary

This report outlines a comprehensive architectural restructuring plan for ProjectHub to establish a sustainable technical foundation. The proposed architecture emphasizes clean domain boundaries, technology independence, and a modular design that facilitates a gradual transition to microservices in the future. The migration will be implemented in three phases over a 10-week period, allowing for continuous delivery while systematically improving the system's architecture.

## Current Architecture Assessment

### Strengths
- Modern technology stack (Spring Boot, Compose UI)
- Feature-rich functionality with comprehensive domain model
- Cross-platform UI strategy with Compose

### Critical Issues
1. **Domain Boundary Violations**: Direct cross-domain dependencies create tight coupling
2. **Technology Infiltration**: Domain entities contain JPA/persistence annotations, violating clean architecture
3. **Module Fragmentation**: Related functionality scattered across multiple packages/modules
4. **Inconsistent Architectural Patterns**: Mixed implementation approaches across the codebase

## Target Architecture: Hexagonal with Microservice Readiness

We propose implementing a hexagonal (ports and adapters) architecture with distinct layers:

```
ProjectHub
├── foundation/ (Core module - contains all domains initially)
│   ├── core/
│   │   ├── domain/            # Pure domain model - technology-free
│   │   ├── application/       # Use cases and domain services
│   │   └── api/               # Domain contracts and DTOs
│   ├── adapter/
│   │   ├── in/                # Controllers, message consumers
│   │   └── out/               # Repository implementations, clients
│   └── config/                # Technical configuration  
└── ui/compose-ui/            # Unified compose UI components
```

### Key Architecture Principles

1. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: Clear domain models with bounded contexts
2. **Dependency Inversion**: Core domain depends on nothing; infrastructure depends on domain
3. **Interface Segregation**: Client-specific interfaces to minimize impact of changes
4. **Event-Driven Communication**: Domain events for cross-domain communication
5. **Microservice Readiness**: Designed to extract domains into separate services

## Domain Structure

Each domain will follow a consistent structure that enables future extraction:

```
domain/ (e.g., project, auth, milestone)
├── model/          # Domain entities and value objects
├── service/        # Domain services implementing business rules  
├── port/           # Interface definitions
│   ├── in/         # Input ports (use case interfaces)
│   └── out/        # Output ports (repository interfaces)
├── application/    # Application services implementing use cases
└── event/          # Domain events for cross-domain communication
```

## Core Blueprint Structure

The foundation module will follow this structure:

```
foundation/
├── core/                           # Domain core - platform independent
│   ├── domain/                     # Pure domain model  
│   │   ├── model/                  # Domain entities
│   │   └── service/                # Domain services
│   └── application/                # Use cases & application services
│       ├── port/                   # Ports (interfaces)
│       │   ├── in/                 # Input ports (API contracts)
│       │   └── out/                # Output ports (repositories, etc)
│       └── service/                # Implementation of use cases
├── infrastructure/                 # Technical concerns
│   ├── persistence/                # Database adapters
│   │   ├── jpa/                    # JPA repositories
│   │   └── mongodb/                # NoSQL repositories (if used)
│   ├── api/                        # API adapters
│   │   ├── rest/                   # REST controllers
│   │   └── graphql/                # GraphQL resolvers
│   ├── messaging/                  # Messaging adapters (Kafka, etc)
│   └── security/                   # Security config & adapters
└── bootstrap/                      # Application bootstrap
    ├── config/                     # Application configuration
    └── ModulithApplication.java    # Main application class
```

## Migration Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Domain Reconstruction (Weeks 1-4)

1. **Domain Model Purification**
   - Separate domain entities from persistence models
   - Remove all JPA annotations from domain entities
   - Create parallel JPA entities in adapter/out/persistence
   - Implement bidirectional mapping between domains and JPA entities

   ```java
   // Before: Domain entity with JPA annotations
   @Entity
   @Table(name = "projects")
   public class Project {
       @Id
       @GeneratedValue
       private UUID id;
       // ...
   }
   
   // After: Clean domain entity
   public class Project {
       private ProjectId id;
       private ProjectName name;
       private ProjectDescription description;
       // ...
   }
   
   // In adapter layer: JPA entity
   @Entity
   @Table(name = "projects")
   public class ProjectJpaEntity {
       @Id
       @GeneratedValue
       private UUID id;
       // ...
   }
   ```

2. **Port Definition**
   - Define input ports (service interfaces) in domain/port/in
   - Create output ports (repository interfaces) in domain/port/out
   - Implement application services using these ports
   
   ```java
   // Input port
   public interface ProjectManagementUseCase {
       ProjectId createProject(CreateProjectCommand command);
       void updateProject(UpdateProjectCommand command);
       // ...
   }
   
   // Output port
   public interface ProjectRepository {
       Optional<Project> findById(ProjectId id);
       void save(Project project);
       // ...
   }
   
   // Application service implementation
   public class ProjectManagementService implements ProjectManagementUseCase {
       private final ProjectRepository projectRepository;
       // ...
   }
   ```

3. **Adapter Implementation**
   - Move REST controllers to adapter/in/web
   - Implement repository adapters in adapter/out/persistence
   - Create event publishers/consumers in adapter/in/messaging

### Phase 2: Cross-Domain Integration (Weeks 5-7)

1. **Domain Event System**
   - Implement domain event publishing mechanism
   - Create event listeners for cross-domain integration
   - Replace direct service calls with event-based communication

   ```java
   // Domain event
   public class ProjectCreatedEvent extends DomainEvent {
       private final ProjectId projectId;
       // ...
   }
   
   // Event publishing in domain service
   public class ProjectService {
       private final EventPublisher eventPublisher;
       
       public Project createProject(...) {
           // ... create project logic
           eventPublisher.publish(new ProjectCreatedEvent(project.getId()));
           return project;
       }
   }
   
   // Event listener in another domain
   @Component
   public class MilestoneProjectCreationListener {
       @EventListener
       public void handleProjectCreated(ProjectCreatedEvent event) {
           // React to project creation
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Bounded Context Definition**
   - Explicitly define context boundaries between domains
   - Implement anti-corruption layers between bounded contexts
   - Create context maps documenting relationships

3. **Configuration Cleanup**
   - Centralize Spring configuration
   - Implement environment-specific profiles
   - Setup feature toggles for new functionality

### Phase 3: Microservice Preparation (Weeks 8-10)

1. **API Versioning Implementation**
   - Define consistent API versioning strategy
   - Create unified API documentation
   - Extract API contracts into separate modules

2. **Service Discovery & Configuration**
   - Implement service registry mechanism (Spring Cloud Netflix or Kubernetes)
   - Setup distributed configuration management
   - Prepare circuit breakers and fault tolerance patterns

3. **Data Independence**
   - Segregate database schemas by domain
   - Implement database-per-service patterns
   - Create data synchronization mechanisms

## Microservice Migration Readiness

The proposed architecture enables gradual extraction of domains into separate microservices:

1. **Modular Monolith Stage** (Initial implementation)
   - Single deployment unit with logical boundaries
   - Domain events for cross-domain communication
   - Clean interfaces between domains

2. **Hybrid Stage** (First microservices extraction)
   - Extract peripheral services first (e.g., reporting, notifications)
   - Maintain core domains in the monolith
   - Implement API gateway for unified access

3. **Full Microservice Stage** (End state)
   - Domain-aligned microservices
   - Dedicated databases per service
   - Event-driven communication

## Integration With Compose UI Strategy

The restructured backend provides ideal integration points for the Compose UI:

1. **Backend-For-Frontend (BFF) Layer**
   - Domain-specific API surfaces for UI requirements
   - GraphQL endpoints for efficient data loading
   - Optimized responses for mobile/desktop clients

2. **Repository Implementation**
   - Platform-specific repositories in the UI connecting to appropriate BFF endpoints
   - Centralized error handling and offline capabilities

## Benefits & Success Criteria

1. **Technology Independence**: 100% separation of domain logic from frameworks
2. **Testability**: 90%+ unit test coverage of domain logic without infrastructure dependencies
3. **Maintainability**: Reduced cognitive load through clear boundaries and responsibilities
4. **Future-Proofing**: Architecture supporting inevitable technological changes
5. **Scalability**: Path to targeted microservices for domains with different scaling needs
6. **Consistency**: Unified approach across all domains

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

1. **Migration Complexity**
   - *Risk*: Extensive refactoring could introduce regressions
   - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive test coverage before changes; incremental approach

2. **Team Adaptation**
   - *Risk*: Team unfamiliarity with hexagonal architecture
   - *Mitigation*: Training sessions; clear documentation; architecture reviews

3. **Performance Overhead**
   - *Risk*: Additional abstraction layers could impact performance
   - *Mitigation*: Performance benchmarking; optimization of critical paths

4. **Timeline Pressure**
   - *Risk*: Business demands may compete with architectural improvements
   - *Mitigation*: Phase implementation; combine with feature development

## Conclusion

The proposed architectural restructuring creates a solid foundation for ProjectHub's future growth. By establishing clean domain boundaries, technology independence, and a modular approach, we enable both immediate improvements in maintainability and a clear path to microservices if and when individual domains need independent scaling or deployment. This architecture supports the existing UI unification strategy and provides a sustainable technical foundation for years to come.
