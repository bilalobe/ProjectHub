## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. Please follow these steps to report a vulnerability:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

2. Send a detailed report to [security@projecthub.com](mailto:security@projecthub.com) including:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested mitigation (if any)

3. You should receive a response within 48 hours acknowledging receipt.

4. Our security team will investigate and provide regular updates.

5. Once resolved, we will:
   - Release a security patch
   - Credit you in our security advisory (if desired)
   - Add the fix to our security changelog

## Security Best Practices

### For Administrators

1. **Initial Setup**
   ```bash
   # Generate a secure encryption key
   ./gradlew generateEncryptionKey
   
   # Initialize security configuration
   ./gradlew initSecurityConfig
   
   # Verify security settings
   ./gradlew verifySecurityConfig
   ```

2. **Regular Maintenance**
   - Rotate encryption keys every 90 days
   - Review audit logs weekly
   - Update security patches promptly
   - Backup security configurations

3. **Monitoring**
   - Enable intrusion detection
   - Monitor failed login attempts
   - Track unusual access patterns
   - Review role assignments monthly

### For Developers

1. **Development Environment**
   - Use security-focused IDE plugins
   - Enable security linting
   - Run SAST scans regularly
   - Follow secure coding guidelines

2. **Code Review**
   - Mandatory security review for auth changes
   - Use secure dependencies only
   - Follow OWASP Top 10 guidelines
   - Implement security testing

### For Users

1. **Account Security**
   - Use strong passwords
   - Enable WebAuthn/passkeys
   - Keep recovery codes safe
   - Report suspicious activity

2. **Access Management**
   - Use principle of least privilege
   - Regular access review
   - Report access issues
   - Follow security training
