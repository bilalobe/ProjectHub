== Overview

ProjectHub implements a comprehensive security architecture integrating Apache Fortress with modern authentication methods and fine-grained authorization controls across all platforms.

== Core Security Components

=== UnifiedSecurityManager

Central security coordination providing:

* Permission evaluation
* Role-based access control
* Resource-level security
* Audit logging

=== Security Hub Integration

=== Permission Model

[options="header"]
|===
|Resource Type|Operations|Example Permissions
|Project|read, write, delete|project:read, project:write
|Task|create, update, assign|task:create, task:assign
|Comment|create, edit, moderate|comment:create, comment:moderate
|Report|view, export, schedule|report:view, report:export
|Plugin|install, configure, execute|plugin:install, plugin:execute
|===

=== Security Layers

==== Authentication
* JWT token management
* WebAuthn/Passkey support
* OAuth2 integration
* Session management

==== Authorization
* Role-based access control
* Resource-level permissions
* Dynamic permission evaluation
* Hierarchical roles

==== Audit
* Security event logging
* Access attempt tracking
* Permission changes
* Resource modifications

== Apache Fortress Integration

=== Core Features Utilized

* Administrative permissions
* Dynamic separation of duties
* Hierarchical role management
* Temporal constraints

=== Custom Extensions

* Real-time permission updates
* Cached permission checks
* Plugin security integration
* Cross-platform security rules

== Security Patterns

=== Permission Caching

[source,kotlin]
----
class PermissionCache {
    private val cache = ConcurrentHashMap<String, CachedPermission>()
    
    data class CachedPermission(
        val permitted: Boolean,
        val expiry: Instant
    )
    
    fun checkPermission(
        userId: String,
        permission: String,
        resourceId: String? = null
    ): Boolean? {
        val key = "$userId:$permission:$resourceId"
        return cache[key]?.takeIf { 
            it.expiry > Instant.now() 
        }?.permitted
    }
}

=== Secure Event Processing

* Event payload validation
* Permission-based filtering
* Sensitive data handling
* Audit trail generation

== Cross-Platform Security

=== Web Security
* CSRF protection
* XSS prevention
* Content Security Policy
* Secure cookie handling

=== Desktop Security
* Secure storage
* Process isolation
* File system security
* Memory protection

=== Mobile Security
* Secure keychain
* Certificate pinning
* App signing
* Secure IPC

== Testing & Validation

=== Security Tests
* Permission validation
* Role hierarchy testing
* Cache behavior verification
* Authentication flows

=== Automated Checks
* Static analysis
* Dependency scanning
* Security annotations
* Architecture rules

== Monitoring & Alerts

=== Security Metrics
* Authentication attempts
* Permission denials
* Cache hit rates
* Session statistics

=== Alert Conditions
* Multiple auth failures
* Permission escalations
* Configuration changes
* System attacks

== Disaster Recovery

=== Backup Procedures
* Permission configurations
* Security audit logs
* User role assignments
* Security settings

=== Recovery Steps
* Permission restoration
* Role hierarchy rebuild
* Security cache reset
* Audit log recovery

== Future Enhancements

=== Planned Features
* Advanced threat detection
* AI-powered security analysis
* Enhanced biometric auth
* Zero-trust architecture

=== Security Roadmap
* Q1: Enhanced monitoring
* Q2: Advanced auth methods
* Q3: AI security features
* Q4: Zero-trust implementation
